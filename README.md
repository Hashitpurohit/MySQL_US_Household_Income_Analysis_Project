Project Description
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of US household income data. It is divided into two main stages:

Data Cleaning: Preparing and standardizing the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Querying the cleaned data to uncover insights, trends, and patterns related to household income across different states, cities, and location types in the United States.

The project uses two primary tables: us_household_income (containing geographical information) and us_household_income_statistics (containing income data like mean and median).

Project Structure
The repository contains two main SQL scripts:

US Houshold_Income (Data Cleaning).sql

US Houshold_Income (Exploratory Data Analysis).sql

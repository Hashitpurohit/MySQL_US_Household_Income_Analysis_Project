## Project Description  
This project performed a **comprehensive analysis of US household income data** using MySQL. It was divided into two main stages:  

1. **Data Cleaning** – Prepared and standardized the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Queried the cleaned data to uncover insights, trends, and patterns related to household income across different states, cities, and location types in the United States.  

The project used two primary tables:  
- **`us_household_income`** → Contained geographical information such as state, city, county, and location type.  
- **`us_household_income_statistics`** → Contained household income data, including mean and median income values.
